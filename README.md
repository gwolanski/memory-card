This Memory Card Game app is a React project I completed as a part of the Odin Project Curriculum. This app is a game where you test your memory by selecting an image that has not been previously selected. The project instructions can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card#project-solution .

This was a fun project where I got to utilize React hooks (useState, useEffect) as well as API integration. I used Unsplash's API to import images into my application. After this project, I realize I'm feeling very comfortable with useState and becoming increasingly familiar with useEffect and situations where it's useful. In order to keep the application responsive on different sized screens, I used Flexbox. Initially, I had set up my image card section using Grid and was planning on adding a couple media queries to make the page layout responsive. However, I realized a much simpler approach would be to utilize Flexbox. Overall, this was a challenging yet fun project where I was able to put my React skills to the test.
